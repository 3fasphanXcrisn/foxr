The game received positive reviews from critics and fans, who praised its improved gameplay mechanics, fluid animations, realistic physics and dynamic weather effects. Some of the drawbacks of the game were its outdated rosters, lack of licenses for some teams and leagues, and poor online performance. The game was also criticized for its similarity to its predecessor, PES 15.
 
PES 16 is available for Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One platforms. The game can be downloaded from various sources online, such as Google Drive[^1^], Fshare[^3^] or Bittorrent[^4^]. However, downloading the game from these sources may be illegal or unsafe, so it is recommended to buy the game from official retailers or online stores. To install the game on Windows, one needs to mount the "rld-prevso2016.iso" file using a software like DAEMON Tools[^4^], run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions. After the installation is complete, one needs to copy the files in the "Crack" folder and paste them where the game was installed. Then, one can open the PES16.exe file and enjoy the game.

PES 16 offers a variety of game modes for players to enjoy. The most popular mode is the Master League, where players can create and manage their own team, sign players, train them, compete in various tournaments and leagues, and try to achieve glory. The Master League mode has been revamped with new features, such as realistic transfers, player development, team spirit, and dynamic rivalries. The mode also has a new presentation style, with cutscenes, interviews, and commentary.
 
Another mode is the MyClub mode, where players can build their own team using coins and GP earned from playing matches or buying them with real money. The MyClub mode allows players to scout and sign players from a pool of over 10,000 players, customize their team's tactics and formations, and challenge other players online. The MyClub mode also has a new feature called Live Updates, where the player's performance and stats are updated weekly based on their real-life performance.
 
PES 16 also has other modes, such as the Become a Legend mode, where players can create and control their own player and try to become a world-class star; the Online Divisions mode, where players can compete in online matches and climb up the ranks; the Exhibition mode, where players can play friendly matches with any team and settings; the Training mode, where players can practice their skills and learn new tricks; and the Edit mode, where players can customize the game's appearance and content.
